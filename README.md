# HTTP Attack Detection System - Interactive Demo

A comprehensive web-based demonstration of an intelligent HTTP-based attack detection system using multi-layer hybrid detection architecture.

## 🎯 Overview

This system demonstrates a production-grade HTTP attack detection solution that identifies and mitigates various types of URL-based cyber attacks in real-time. The solution combines rule-based pattern matching with machine learning for optimal detection accuracy and performance.

## 🚀 Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **11+ Attack Types Detected:**
  - SQL Injection (Union, Blind, Time-based, Error-based)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
  - Directory Traversal / Path Manipulation
  - Command Injection
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
  - Credential Stuffing / Brute Force
  - HTTP Parameter Pollution
  - XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  - Web Shell Uploads
  - Typosquatting / URL Spoofing

### Architecture
- **Layer 1: Rule-Based Engine** - Fast path detection (<1ms) for known patterns
- **Layer 2: ML Detection Engine** - Smart path (1-5ms) using Random Forest Classifier
- **Hybrid Scoring System** - Aggregates confidence scores from both layers
- **Time-Series Storage** - InfluxDB/TimescaleDB for IPDR analysis
- **Real-Time Analytics** - Interactive dashboard with visualizations

### User Interface
- **Interactive Workflow Visualization** - Animated system architecture
- **Live Detection Demo** - Upload PCAP files or test URLs
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Charts, graphs, and threat intelligence
- **Export Functionality** - Results in CSV/JSON format

}
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed
Modify timing in `app.js`:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    stage.classList.add('active');
}, index * 1500); // Adjust delay here
```

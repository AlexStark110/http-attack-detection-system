## 🚀 Quick Start

Visit the live demo at: **https://your-project.vercel.app**

## ✨ Features

- **11+ Attack Types** detected including SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, and more
- **Interactive Workflow Visualization** with animated data flow
- **Real-Time Demo** with PCAP upload and URL testing
- **Analytics Dashboard** with Chart.js visualizations
- **Export Functionality** to CSV and JSON formats

## 🏗️ Architecture

This system uses a hybrid multi-layer detection approach:
- **Layer 1:** Rule-Based Engine (< 1ms)
- **Layer 2:** ML Detection Engine (1-5ms)
- **Hybrid Scoring:** Aggregated confidence from both layers
